## â˜­ Greetings Comrades â˜­

<!--
**joyhyunki/joyhyunki** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
My friend's flashcard program. It's fun trying out github.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
C++ / Java. First time learning them, and since I'm a lazy coder, it might take a decade or so for me to finish :)
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
Open source video games. I can code with Python, Javascript, and GDScript. If you're developing an open source game and need someone to find bugs or add a cool new feature, don't hesitate to contact me. I don't need any wages at all; isn't that a huge plus, xaxa.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
My open source civbuilder game. Nobody's going to pay attention, but I'm planning to make the simulator until middle ages. If possible, I'd like to make multiplayer in that game to battle other players, just like clash of clans or something.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
Anything. Whatever you want. Just remember that a foolish question will be replied by a foolish answer.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
Email me at **joyhyunki@gmail.com**. Make the title something short and simple so that I won't see your mail as a spam :(
I don't have any SNS accounts, so it's impossible to contact me with twitter, facebook, or instagram. Pity.
  
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
He/him. Questions?
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
I have to study for midterms for now; isn't that delightful?
OK, for real **FUN** stuffs... well... I play boardgames and videogames. I also play warhammer 40k, though nobody plays it nearby me.
I code, I read, I procrastinate assignments... the usual.
Oh, finally, I'm really good at smashing and completely destroying imperialist code. XD
